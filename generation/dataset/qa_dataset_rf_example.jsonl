{"type": "Terminology explanation", "query": "What is the difference between variables and nets in Verilog?", "answer": "In Verilog, variables (such as reg and integer) are things that behavioral code can assign values to. They differ from nets, which include constructs like wires, used to represent connections between hardware components.", "reference": "gate    .functor and, gate.0, gate.1; reg and other variables Reg and integer are cases of what Verilog calls variables .\nVariables are, simply put, things that behavioral code can assign\nto. These are not the same as nets , which include wires and the\nlike. Each bit of a variable is created by a .var statement. For example: reg a; becomes: a       .var \"a\", 0, 0; named events Events in general are implemented as functors, but named events in\nparticular have no inputs and only the event output. The way to\ngenerate code for these is like so: a  .event \"name\"; This creates a functor and makes it into a mode-2 functor. Then the\ntrigger statement, “-> a”, cause a %set a, 0; statement be\ngenerated. This is sufficient to trigger the event. Automatically Allocated Scopes ¶ If a .scope statement has a <type> of autofunction or autotask, the\nscope is flagged as being an automatically allocated scope. The functor\nfor each variable or event declared in that scope is added to a list\nof items that need to be automatically allocated for each dynamic\ninstance of that scope. Before copying the input parameters of an automatic function or task\ninto the scope variables, a new scope instance needs to be allocated.\nFor function or task calls in procedural code, this is handled by the\n%alloc instruction. For structural function calls, this is handled\nby the phantom code generated by the .ufunc statement. In both cases,\nVVP attempts to use a previously freed scope instance - only if none\nare available is a new instance created. After copying the result of an automatic function or the output\nparameters of an automatic task, the scope instance can be freed.\nFor function or task calls in procedural code, this is handled by the\n%free instruction. For structural function calls, this is handled\nby the phantom code generated by the .ufunc statement. In both cases,\nVVP adds the instance to a list of freed instances for that scope,\nwhich allows the storage to be reused the next time a new instance\nis required. For each automatically allocated scope instance, VVP creates an array\nof items, referred to as the scope context. Each item in this array is\na pointer to the allocated storage for holding the state of one scope\nvariable or event. The index into this array for any given variable\nor event, referred to as the context index, is stored in the functor\nassociated with that variable or event. Each VVP thread keeps track of its current write context and current\nread context. For threads executing in a static scope, these are both\ninitialized to null values. For threads executing in an automatically\nallocated scope, these are both initialized to refer to the context\nallocated to that scope. Before starting the copying of the input parameters of an automatic\nfunction or task, the current write context of the caller thread is\nset to the context allocated for that function/task call.

This allows\nprogrammers to write C code that interfaces with Verilog simulations to\nperform tasks otherwise impractical with straight Verilog. Many Verilog\ndesigners, especially those who only use Verilog as a synthesis tool, can\nsafely ignore the entire matter of the PLI (and this chapter) but the designer\nwho wishes to interface a simulation with the outside world cannot escape VPI.

How It Works ¶ The VPI modules are compiled loadable object code that the runtime loads at\nthe user’s request. The user commands vvp to locate and load modules with the\n“-m” switch. For example, to load the “sample.vpi” module: % vvp -msample foo.vvp The vvp run-time loads the modules first, before executing any of the\nsimulation, or even before compiling the vvp code.

(There is a special module, the system.vpi module, that is always loaded to\nprovide the core system tasks.)

The following simple C definition\ndefines a sample table: void (*vlog_startup_routines[])() = {\n   hello_register,\n   0\n}; Note that the “vlog_startup_routines” table is an array of function pointers,\nwith the last pointer a 0 to mark the end. The programmer can organize the\nmodule to include many startup functions in this table, if desired. The job of the startup functions that are collected in the startup table is to\ndeclare the system tasks and functions that the module provides. A module may\nimplement as many tasks/functions as desired, so a module can legitimately be\ncalled a library of system tasks and functions. Compiling VPI Modules ¶ To compile and link a VPI module for use with Icarus Verilog, you must compile\nall the source files of a module as if you were compiling for a DLL or shared\nobject. With gcc under Linux, this means compiling with the “-fpic” flag. The\nmodule is then linked together with the vpi library like so: % gcc -c -fpic hello.c\n% gcc -shared -o hello.vpi hello.o -lvpi This assumes that the “vpi_user.h header file and the libvpi.a library file\nare installed on your system so that gcc may find them.

An easier, the preferred method that works\non all supported systems is to use the single command: % iverilog-vpi hello.c The “iverilog-vpi” command takes as command arguments the source files for\nyour VPI module, compiles them with proper compiler flags, and links them into\na vpi module with any system specific libraries and linker flags that are\nrequired.

An easier, the preferred method that works\non all supported systems is to use the single command: % iverilog-vpi hello.c The “iverilog-vpi” command takes as command arguments the source files for\nyour VPI module, compiles them with proper compiler flags, and links them into\na vpi module with any system specific libraries and linker flags that are\nrequired. This simple command makes the “hello.vpi” module with minimum fuss. A Worked Example ¶ Let us try a complete, working example. Place the C code that follows into the\nfile hello.c: # include  <vpi_user.h>\n\nstatic int hello_compiletf(char*user_data)\n{\n      return 0;\n}\n\nstatic int hello_calltf(char*user_data)\n{\n      vpi_printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\n      return 0;\n}\n\nvoid hello_register()\n{\n      s_vpi_systf_data tf_data;", "source": "iverilog"}

{"type": "Terminology explanation", "query": "What is the Amaranth standard library?", "answer": "The Amaranth standard library is a set of components that simplify code portability and reduce changes when migrating between different FPGA families. It also simplifies peripherals, test benches, and simulations, though it's optional and not required to use Amaranth.", "reference": "integration included with Amaranth. While many designs will use at least some vendor-specific functionality, the components provided by the Amaranth standard library reduce the amount of code that needs to be changed when migrating between FPGA families, and the common interfaces simplify peripherals, test benches and simulations. The Amaranth standard library is optional: the Amaranth language can be used without it. Conversely, it is possible to use the Amaranth standard library components in Verilog or VHDL code, with some limitations. The Amaranth simulator  The Amaranth project includes an advanced simulator for Amaranth code implemented in Python with no system dependencies; in this simulator, test benches are written as Python generator functions. Of course, it is always possible to convert an Amaranth design to Verilog for use with well-known tool like Icarus Verilog or Verilator . The Amaranth simulator is event-driven and can simulate designs with multiple clocks or asynchronous resets. Although it is slower than Icarus Verilog , it compiles the netlist to Python code ahead of time, achieving remarkably high performance for a pure Python implementation—especially when running on PyPy . Although Amaranth does not support native code simulation or co-simulation at the moment, such support will be added in near future. The Amaranth build system  To achieve an end-to-end FPGA development workflow, the Amaranth project integrates with all major FPGA toolchains and provides definitions for many common development boards. FPGA toolchain integration  Each FPGA family requires the use of synthesis and place & route tools specific for that device family. The Amaranth build system directly integrates with every major open-source and commercial FPGA toolchain, and can be easily extended to cover others. Through this integration, Amaranth can specialize the CDC primitives and I/O buffers for a particular device and toolchain; generate I/O and clock constraints from board definition files; synchronize the power-on reset in single-clock designs; include (System)Verilog and VHDL files in the design (if supported by the toolchain); and finally, generate a script running synthesis, placement, routing, and timing analysis. The generated code can be customized to insert additional options, commands, constraints, and so on. The Amaranth build system produces self-contained, portable build trees that require only the toolchain to be present in the environment. This makes builds easier to reproduce, or to run on a remote machine. The generated build scripts are always provided for both *nix and Windows. Development board definitions  Getting started with a new FPGA development board often requires going through a laborous and error-prone process of deriving toolchain configuration and constraint files from the supplied documentation. The Amaranth project includes a community-maintained repository of definitions for many open-source and commercial FPGA development boards. These board definitions contain everything that is necessary to start using the board: FPGA family and model, clocks and resets, descriptions of on-board peripherals (including pin direction and attributes such as I/O standard), connector pinouts, and for boards with a built-in debug probe, the steps required to program the board. It takes a single Python invocation to generate, build, and download a test design that shows whether the board, toolchain, and programmer are working correctly.
