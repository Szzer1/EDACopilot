The delegate is an object of a class derived from NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate which reimplements several methods to customize the following parts:\n\nA global header (NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#write_header): this method is called to print the part right after the headline\n\nA per-device class header (NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#write_device_intro): this method is called for every device class and may print device-class specific headers (e.g. model definitions)\n\nPer-device output: this method (NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#write_device): this method is called for every device and may print the device statement(s) in a specific way.\n\nThe delegate must use NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#emit_line to print a line, NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#emit_comment to print a comment etc. For more method see NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate.\n\nA sample with a delegate is this:\n\nclass MyDelegate < RBA::NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate\n\n  def write_header\n    emit_line(\"*** My special header\")\n  end\n\n  def write_device_intro(cls)\n    emit_comment(\"My intro for class \" + cls.name)\n  end\n\n  def write_device(dev)\n    if dev.device_class.name != \"MYDEVICE\"\n      emit_comment(\"Terminal #1: \" + net_to_string(dev.net_for_terminal(0)))\n      emit_comment(\"Terminal #2: \" + net_to_string(dev.net_for_terminal(1)))\n      super(dev)\n      emit_comment(\"After device \" + dev.expanded_name)\n    else\n      super(dev)\n    end\n  end\n\nend\n\n# write the netlist with delegate:\nwriter = RBA::NetlistSpiceWriter::new(MyDelegate::new)\nnetlist.write(path, writer)\n\nThis class has been introduced in version 0.26.\n\nPublic constructors\n\nnew NetlistSpiceWriter ptr new Creates a new writer without delegate. new NetlistSpiceWriter ptr new (NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate ptr delegate) Creates a new writer with a delegate.\n\nPublic methods\n\n[const] NetlistSpiceWriter ptr _const_cast Returns a non-const reference to self. void _create Ensures the C++ object is created void _destroy Explicitly destroys the object [const] bool _destroyed?

Basically, this method allows turning a const object reference to a non-const one. This method is provided as last resort to remove the constness from an object. Usually there is a good reason for a const object reference, so using this method may have undesired side effects.

After calling this method on an object, the script side will be responsible for the management of the object. This method may be called if an object is returned from a C++ function and the object is known not to be owned by any C++ instance. If necessary, the script side may delete the object if the script's reference is no longer required. Usually it's not required to call this method. It has been introduced in version 0.24. _unmanage Signature : void _unmanage Description : Marks the object as no longer owned by the script side. Calling this method will make this object no longer owned by the script's memory management. Instead, the object must be managed in some other way. Usually this method may be called if it is known that some C++ object holds and manages this object. Technically speaking, this method will turn the script's reference into a weak reference. After the script engine decides to delete the reference, the object itself will still exist. If the object is not managed otherwise, memory leaks will occur. Usually it's not required to call this method. It has been introduced in version 0.24. create Signature : void create Description : Ensures the C++ object is created Use of this method is deprecated.

This helps the filter algorithm optimizing the filter run, specifically in hierarchical mode. Examples for isotropic (polygon) processors are size or shrink operators. Size or shrink is not dependent on orientation unless size or shrink needs to be different in x and y direction. is_isotropic_and_scale_invariant Signature : void is_isotropic_and_scale_invariant Description : Indicates that the filter is isotropic and scale invariant Call this method before using the filter to indicate that the selection is independent of the scale and orientation of the shape. This helps the filter algorithm optimizing the filter run, specifically in hierarchical mode. An example for such a (polygon) processor is the convex decomposition operator. The decomposition of a polygon into convex parts is an operation that is not depending on scale nor orientation. is_scale_invariant Signature : void is_scale_invariant Description : Indicates that the filter is scale invariant Call this method before using the filter to indicate that the selection is independent of the scale of the shape. This helps the filter algorithm optimizing the filter run, specifically in hierarchical mode. An example for a scale invariant (polygon) processor is the rotation operator. Rotation is not depending on scale, but on the original orientation as mirrored versions need to be rotated differently. new Signature : [static] new EdgePairToEdgeOperator ptr new Description : Creates a new object of this class Python specific notes: This method is the default initializer of the object. process Signature : [virtual,const] Edge [] process (const EdgePair shape) Description : Processes a shape This method is the actual payload.

After calling this method on an object, the script side will be responsible for the management of the object. This method may be called if an object is returned from a C++ function and the object is known not to be owned by any C++ instance. If necessary, the script side may delete the object if the script's reference is no longer required. Usually it's not required to call this method. It has been introduced in version 0.24. _unmanage Signature : void _unmanage Description : Marks the object as no longer owned by the script side. Calling this method will make this object no longer owned by the script's memory management. Instead, the object must be managed in some other way. Usually this method may be called if it is known that some C++ object holds and manages this object. Technically speaking, this method will turn the script's reference into a weak reference. After the script engine decides to delete the reference, the object itself will still exist. If the object is not managed otherwise, memory leaks will occur.

However, the flat approach may limit its use to small to medium-sized, almost flat layouts.", "reference": "options. Details about this function can be found in the Importing other\nlayout files section in the advanced features manual. A simple XOR tool providing a flat XOR between two layouts. A tolerance can be set to suppress small deviations. A tiling option is provided to\nreduce memory requirements for large layouts. The flat approach probably\nlimits the application to \"almost flat\", small to medium sized layouts.\nDetails about this function can be found in the The XOR tool section in\nthe advanced features manual. A net tracing tool to trace single nets of conductive layers connected through via shapes. The function is intended for extracting single small\nnets and it's not performance optimized for the case of huge power nets.\nDetails about this function can be found in the The net tracing feature\nsection in the advanced features manual. A navigator window that shows current view's rectangle and allows to control the rectangle by dragging or resizing it. Multi threading support for drawing increases the drawing performance on multi-core CPU's by rendering different layers on different CPU's. The\nnumber of threads to use can be set in the setup dialog in the \"Display\"\ngroup under \"Optimizations\". By default, a single thread is used. \"Make array\" method (\"Edit/Selection\" menu) to multiply the selection into an array arrangement. A function to add a layout already loaded to a view (\"File/Pull In Other Layout\"). A function to scan a layer's geometry and create a marker database from that. The menu function is found in the \"Tools/Verification\" menu. It\nwill scan all selected layers either flat or hierarchical and create a\nmarker database containing the shapes as markers. Layer mapping on input: the reader options now allow to specify a mapping together with a layer specification. In addition to specifying\nthe layers to read, a target can be given which specifies which layer\nthe shapes will be stored under (See \"Reader Options\" dialog found in\nthe \"File\" menu). A couple of new display options: o Abstract mode (shows only the outer interfacing shapes of child cells.\no Child hierarchy level layout can be configured to be shown in different\nbrightness, hollow fill or static neutral color to differentiate top\nlevel from bottom level layout.\no Enhancements for the hierarchy level specifications in the layer source\nnotation. A log viewer is provided to catch warning messages. The menu entry to open the log viewer is found in the \"File\" menu. The setup dialog has been reorganized to make room for more property pages. Instances now show the cell's content when being moved instead just a rectangle. This feature can be disabled. Various usability enhancements (i.e. mouse cursor now shows activity, status bar shows short shape statistics etc.). An option to not write empty cells. Support for missing cells in the input layout: those cells get marked and are not produced in the output unless they have received content.

To write the database for just the top-level cell, do:\n\nwriteall force map9v3\n\nThe circuit above was routed with qflow version 1.1.55 using power striping as described above, and routing on the first three layers only.\n\nNow quit Magic to lose the abstract cell views (say \"Yes\" to the prompt, you really do want to exit!)\n\nIf you have downloaded the OSU standard cell set, skip this step and go to the next one. Otherwise, download the file osu035_stdcells.gds2 from the download list at the top of the page (put it in the layout subdirectory). I recommend downloading the OSU standard cell set from the OSU website to get the most up-to-date version. However, the version posted here will suffice for the tutorial.\n\nBecause there are a lot of standard cells, you may want to keep these layout views in a subdirectory of the layout directory, so from the layout directory, do:\n\nmkdir digital cp .magicrc digital cd digital\n\nStart magic without specifying a file to load:\n\nmagic -d XR\n\nThen load the GDS file, and save all of the standard cells:\n\ngds read osu035_stdcells.gds2 writeall force quit", "source": "qflow"}

We could add an way to directly load the yosys output.  In either case you won't see any layout as nothing has been placed but you can use the usual timing path viewer.\nYou can't use yosys commands in OR as they are different tools.\nmaliberty\nIn the GUI from Windows->Timing Report you can get the path viewer.  When you select items in the path viewer you can see them in the inspector if you need to get more physical/netlist details.\nmaliberty\n@vijayank88 are there any tutorials for timing debug?\nmaliberty\nFwiw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lkKp-gL1Ow\nvijayank88\n@oharboe \nOnly after placement you can trace timing path in OpenROAD gui.\nYou can refer logs/nangate45/gcd/base/2_1_floorplan.log (gcd example). It is the first OpenSTA timing report post synthesis.\nmaliberty\nYou can really only do back annotation after you reach a fully routed result.  There is nothing to back annotate before that.  That is already supported in ORFS and the make gui_final will load the parasitics automatically.\nYou can generate timing report at any step of the flow.  Pre-placement you will get wire load models.  Later in the flow we use estimate_parasitics with -placement (after CTS) or -global_routing (after global routing).  Post-routing we use rcx extracted values.\nYosys 'schematics' are a capability of yosys and have nothing to do with OR.  The timing report already contains a list of all the cells/ports/nets so a schematic doesn't add much for a path.
